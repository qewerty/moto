Some things for config
======================

 * Use GLSL for drawing selected elements. Needs additional memory
   to store selection vertex atribute varying data, but should be faster.
 * Use GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object extension (if supported) for MotoMeshViewNode.
 * Use GLSL vertex shaders for object transformations.
 * Use GLSL vertex shaders for mesh deformation. It works only if all mesh modifiers
   provide correct GLSL code for deformation.
